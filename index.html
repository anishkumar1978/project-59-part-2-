         Hello everyone! My name is Aishwarya and I am in 7th grade. Let me tell you about my hobbies:- I love to cycle and skate as they both give me a sense of freedom which is priceless! I also love to read mystery and fiction books and diaries. Sherlock Holmes, Nancy Drew, Adventure Series are some of favourites. I also have a soft spot for cooking goodies. Coding is also my favourite hobby to do while I am bored. When you give the correct code, an amazing output comes. How cool is that?! Attempting scientific expiriments are also my favourite. Pouring 1 substance to another to form another component. I also love to dance and sing. Ed Sheeren, Alan Walker, Marshmello, AR Rahaman are a few of my favourite singers.Listening to music is what I love the most.

        <h1>My Favourite Books</h1>
        <div>
    <p>
        Books are great source of information for the readers. Even a fiction book! Fiction books can increase the imaginative skills of the reader which can help them to write stories or poems. My favourite types of books are the ones that have mystery, fiction and adventures. This is one of the main reason why I like Nancy Drew series.

    <p> When I was in 5th standared we went to an orphanage near my school. I brought many old text books and pencils of mine to give it to the kids. I even brought packets of chips and biscuits for the kids. The kids were very happy to recieve the items that we brought. When I saw the smiles on their faces I felt happy to help them.
